# Student Performance Prediction - ML Regression

This repository explores **predicting secondary-school students’ final grades** using a multivariate dataset of 649 records and 30 features.  
The project demonstrates how different regression algorithms perform on the same task and how hyperparameter tuning can significantly improve accuracy.

## Key Steps
- **Baseline Models**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) with various kernels.
- **Feature Engineering**: Data cleaning, scaling, and exploratory analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: Train/test split with R² score as the main metric.
